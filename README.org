#+title: Custom Startpage
#+author: Lars M
This is a super small project just for fun. Making my own startpage for the web browser. Still a work in progress.. For now I've only implemented searching using the google-engine.

Made with html, css and vanilla javascript.

#+html: <p align="center"><img src="startpage.png" /></p>

** Todo:
- Make it possible to change search-engine
- Make dynamic welcome message
- Add more links?
- RSS-feed widget?
- Improve style: hover effects etc..

** Note (New tab page)
You need an extention to set custome new tab in firefox. And all of them need a URL starting with http or https, so there is not possible to set a local file as the new tab page as far as I know..
